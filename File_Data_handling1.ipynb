        "\n",
        "  - **Improves Responsiveness**\n",
        "\n",
        "  In GUI applications (like desktop software), multithreading keeps the interface responsive while background tasks (e.g., file downloads, computations) run.\n",
        "\n",
        " Example: You can scroll or click buttons while a file is being loaded in the background.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Better Use of I/O Wait Time**\n",
        "\n",
        "    - In I/O-bound tasks (e.g., reading files, network communication), the CPU often sits idle while waiting.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Multithreading lets other threads run during that waiting time.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Example: A web server can handle thousands of requests because it doesnâ€™t block while waiting for a file or a database response.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Simpler Program Structure**\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Threads are often easier to implement than multiple processes when you need shared memory or communication between tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Parallelism on Multi-core CPUs (with caution)**\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Pythonâ€™s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits true parallel execution of Python bytecode, but multithreading still helps in I/O-heavy programs.\n",
